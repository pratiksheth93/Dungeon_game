Designed a Dungeon Game

Designed a random dungeon map. Here, the player starts from one side of the dungeon (South) and tries to reach the other side of the dungeon before time runs out. If the player reaches the other side before time runs out, increase player points and load next level. Player can collect gold coins to gain more points. Displayed on-screen timer and points indicator. Three chances are given to try the same map before the timer runs out.
